By using the modern object-oriented programming language Python (e.g. tkinter and pandas modules) and a chemoinformatics open source library (RDKit), the classic Joback and Reid group contribution method was revisited and written into a graphical user interface programâ€”JRgui. The underlying algorithm behind the program is explained, herein, with the user being able to operate the program in either a manual and automatic mode. In the manual mode, the users are required to determine the type and occurrence of functional groups in the compound of interest and manually enter into the program. In the automatic mode, both of these parameters can be detected automatically via user input of the compound SMILES string. An additional advantage of the automatic mode is that a large number of molecules can be processed simultaneously by parsing their individual SMILES strings into a text file which is read by the program. The resulting predicted physical properties along with approximately 200 molecular descriptors are saved in a spreadsheet file for subsequent analysis. It is hoped that the current work may facilitate the creation of other user friendly programs in the chemoinformatics community by using Python.

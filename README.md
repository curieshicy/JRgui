## A brief description of JRgui program:

By using the modern object-oriented programming language Python (e.g. tkinter and pandas modules) and a chemoinformatics open source library (RDKit), the classic Joback and Reid group contribution method was revisited and written into a graphical user interface programâ€”JRgui. The underlying algorithm behind the program is explained, herein, with the user being able to operate the program in either a manual and automatic mode. In the manual mode, the users are required to determine the type and occurrence of functional groups in the compound of interest and manually enter into the program. In the automatic mode, both of these parameters can be detected automatically via user input of the compound SMILES string. An additional advantage of the automatic mode is that a large number of molecules can be processed simultaneously by parsing their individual SMILES strings into a text file which is read by the program. The resulting predicted physical properties along with approximately 200 molecular descriptors are saved in a spreadsheet file for subsequent analysis. It is hoped that the current work may facilitate the creation of other user friendly programs in the chemoinformatics community by using Python.

## Install and Use JRgui program (Support Windows, Linux, macOS, 64-bit systems): 
### Recommended Installation Method--Using <b>Conda install</b>

The recommended way to install JRgui is via <b>conda install</b>. The initial step is to install Anaconda python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for Windows, Linux or macOS. Choose 64-bit and Python 3.6 version for download and install. After download and install it, start a terminal (in Windows use <b>Anaconda Prompt</b> NOT default terminal), type <b>conda --version</b> to check if conda has been successfully installed. 

Once conda has been installed, (in the terminal) type the following two commands

<b>conda config --add channels rdkit</b> 

<b>conda create -c curieshicy -n my-jrgui-env jrgui</b> 

The first command adds the channel of a dependency package--rdkit. The second one-line command first adds my conda channel <b>curieshicy</b> and then creates a virtural environment named <b>my-jrgui-env</b> where all dependency Python packages will be installed. The usage of a virtural environment has the advantage of avoiding potential conflicts of different versioned Python installed at default system path. The specific environment created will be only used for JRgui program. After executing these two line-commands Conda will automatically find dependency packages and install them all. 

To use JRgui program, the users first need to activate the virtural environment (in Windows type <b>activate my-jrgui-env</b>; in Linux and MacOS type <b>source activate my-jrgui-env</b>. To quit virtural environment replace <b>activate</b> with <b>deactivate</b>), and type <b>jrgui</b> to invoke the GUI. 

### What if Conda install fails?
(It is not supposed to but...) For some reason, if the conda install method fails, the users can always down the source codes and mannual invoke the GUI interface. To do this, for example, on a Windows platform, first install rdkit package (make sure Anaconda has been installed) by type

<b>conda create -c rdkit -n my-rdkit-env rdkit</b>

Download the source codes (to e.g. C:\Users\Desktop\username\Source_Codes), open an Anaconda Prompt terminal, activate rdkit environment by typing 

<b>activate my-rdkit-env</b>

navigate to <b>Source_Codes</b> folder, and type 

<b>python jrgui.py</b> 

to invoke the GUI interface.


### Last resort (not recommended)

For Windows users (7, 8 and 10, 64-bit), the standalone executable files are also available in the release page (https://github.com/curieshicy/JRgui/releases). The users only need to download the exe file for their operation system. Simply double-click it to invoke the GUI. These executables were created by using Pyinstaller Development version. All these files worked well on my computers, however, this does not mean it works on your specific Windows platform. You may give it a try if you wish to.
